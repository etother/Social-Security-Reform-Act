To protect Social Security funds from misuse, eliminate corporate profiteering, ensure fair benefits for all workers, and strengthen financial sustainability without raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.

1. Social Security is a vital program funded by American workers and should not be exploited by private corporations or misused by politicians.


2. The Social Security Trust Fund has been misallocated for non-Social Security expenditures, creating financial instability.


3. Private interests, including Wall Street firms, insurance companies, and legal entities, profit excessively from Social Security-related services while retirees and workers struggle.


4. Structural inefficiencies in the Social Security Administration (SSA) delay and deny rightful benefits to eligible retirees and disabled individuals.
